## Assisted Problems

These problems are typically introduced with guidance and are great for getting started.

### 1. Welcome to Bridgelabz!
* **Problem:** Write a program that prints "Welcome to Bridgelabz!" to the screen.
* **Concepts:** Basic output.

### 2. Add Two Numbers
* **Problem:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum.
* **Concepts:** User input, variable assignment, addition.

### 3. Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
* **Problem:** Write a program that takes the temperature in Celsius as input and converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula: $Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32$.
* **Concepts:** User input, arithmetic operations, floating-point numbers.

### 4. Area of a Circle
* **Problem:** Write a program to calculate the area of a circle. Take the radius as input and use the formula: $Area = \pi * radius^2$.
* **Concepts:** User input, arithmetic operations, using mathematical constants (like $\pi$).

### 5. Volume of a Cylinder
* **Problem:** Write a program to calculate the volume of a cylinder. Take the radius and height as inputs and use the formula: $Volume = \pi * radius^2 * height$.
* **Concepts:** User input, arithmetic operations, using mathematical constants.

## Self Problems

These problems encourage independent problem-solving after gaining some initial understanding.

### 1. Calculate Simple Interest
* **Problem:** Write a program to calculate simple interest using the formula: $Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100$. Take Principal, Rate, and Time as inputs from the user.
* **Concepts:** User input, multiple variable inputs, arithmetic operations.

### 2. Perimeter of a Rectangle
* **Problem:** Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle. Take the length and width as inputs and use the formula: $Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)$.
* **Concepts:** User input, arithmetic operations.

### 3. Power Calculation
* **Problem:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input: a base and an exponent, and prints the result of base raised to the exponent (without using loops or conditionals).
* **Concepts:** User input, exponentiation (using built-in functions or operators depending on the language).

### 4. Calculate Average of Three Numbers
* **Problem:** Write a program that takes three numbers as input from the user and prints their average.
* **Concepts:** User input, addition, division.

### 5. Convert Kilometers to Miles
* **Problem:** Write a program that takes the distance in kilometers as input from the user and converts it into miles using the formula: $Miles = Kilometers * 0.621371$.
* **Concepts:** User input, arithmetic operations, floating-point numbers.
